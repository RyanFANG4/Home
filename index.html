			Born in the small town of Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, England. Rick Astley suffered briefly through piano lessons, but was not particularly invested in the instrument and soon quit. As he told Miller, he &quot;was dragged into the choir, like anybody else who could half sing, and into school plays.&quot; But as an adolescent Astley reserved his true musical enthusiasm for the drums, and he formed a band called Give Way with friends when he was about fifteen years old. &quot;We never did play many gigsâ€¦We were too young, and none of us could drive.&quot;
		</p>
		<p class="info">
			After Astley had learned to drive, he played drums for a group named FBI. When FBI found itself playing in small local clubs, Astley found himself writing songs. His fellow band members urged him to fight his shyness and sing them; they liked the results so much that they hired another drummer so Astley could devote himself to vocals. Late in 1985 the production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken, and Pete Waterman--who also handle artists such as Bananarama and Samantha Fox--were part of one of Astley's audiences. Waterman recounted his reaction in People magazine: &quot;He had a phenomenal voice. It was like hearing a 40-year-old black man while seeing this 19-year-old white pimply kid.&quot;

		<p class="info">
			After some polishing up, &quot;Whenever You Need Somebody&quot; was recorded and released. In addition to the already famous &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;. Astley scored hits with &quot;Together Forever&quot;,&quot;It Would Take a Strong, Strong Man,&quot; and the title track. Critics had praise for his striking voice, but many complained that the songs lacked something. Astley however, is untroubled by their opinion, explains his own philosophy about his work as something that is fun, and says that he is not trying to put any messages across because he doesn't think politics and pop music mix. He also states that it doesn't seem right to make people aware of your own views.

		<h2> Retirement </h2>
		<p class="info">
			1993, Astley retired from the music industry at 27, deciding that family life was more important. During this time out of the music business, he raised his daughter Emilie, borin in 1992. For much of the 1990's to the early 2000's, Astley remained out of the spotlight. He later said this was due to his growing frustration with the business side of things. During this period, he co-wrote &quot;Mission Statement&quot;, a track for former Marillion singer Fish's 1999 solo album, &quot;Raingods with Zippos&quot;.
