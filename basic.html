		<h1> Rick Astley's Social Influence on the World </h1>
		<p class="info">
			Everyone knows the internet phenomenon known as Rick rolling. it all started back in 2007, where the meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video. When victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected, and in doing so, they are said to have been &quot;Rickrolled&quot;. The meme also extended to using the song's lyrics in unexpecting placed. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicizing events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event. Rickrolling saw a massive resurgence online in the early 2020's. In online classes on Zoom during the worldwide COVID-19 lockdown, students often rickrolled their classmates and teachers.

			Here are the lyrics to &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Never Gonna Give You Up</a>&quot;
		</p>
		<p class="info">
			The meme originated because of the unusual lyrics that make up this song. One would not expect to hear &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; in any random scenario, because that would make no sense, which is what this meme does. The bait and switch tactic makes a victim click on a hidden link or file, and then suddenly gets redirected into a video or audio clip with the extremely iconic intro to &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;. It has not died out since, because of how unique and original the song is, and it's how most people in the modern world know Rick Astley to this day.
